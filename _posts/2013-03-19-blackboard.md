For a class, I worked and four other students researched the workflow of
college students via a contextual inquiry. I took this data forward into
redesigning one of the most disliked pieces of software on the planet,
Blackboard.

### User Research

Our team found breakdowns in how students organized, completed,
and submitted their work. We wanted to find out how these problems
precludes learning, and how we could fix them.

We conducted contextual inquiries with 5 CMU students, and
combined data from these interviews into cultural, sequence, and
flow models. See [contextual inquiry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry).

interviews were organized into themes.</p>

### Ideation
After doing this user-needs research with the group for class, I decided
to take this research a step forward and consider a blackboard redesign.

### Interactive UI Concept
When preparing for an
assignment, students check emails, syllabi, schedules, slides, and
various Blackboard sections to get the information they need. By
centralizing and parsing this information, Blackboard could present
everything in a much simpler, task list & calendar based format.

To further test the interactivity of this concept, I developed an
interactive HTML prototype. I used an organizational convention students
were familiar with, akin to color-coded binder sections. Preliminary
testing suggests this works well with students.
