At YinzCam, I was tasked with redesignin RockYourJersey, a webiste for
sports events like the NFL PLayoffs, Super Bowl, NHL Winter Classic, and
Penn State White & Blue game. The website was meant to generate buzz
around the event, and create social media traction for event sponsors.

This was one of the my first experiences both designing and developing
an application.

I created Illustrator scripts to generate vectors of 1000's of
professional jerseys for RockYourJersey.
