<p>For a class, I worked and four other students researched the workflow of college students via a contextual inquiry. I took this data forward into redesigning one of the most disliked pieces of software on the planet, Blackboard.</p>

<h3 id='user_research'>User Research</h3>

<p>Our team found breakdowns in how students organized, completed, and submitted their work. We wanted to find out how these problems precludes learning, and how we could fix them.</p>

<p>We conducted contextual inquiries with 5 CMU students, and combined data from these interviews into cultural, sequence, and flow models. See <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry'>contextual inquiry</a>.</p>

<p>After doing this user-needs research with the group for class, I decided to take this research a step forward and consider a blackboard redesign.</p>

<h3 id='interactive_ui_concept'>Interactive UI Concept</h3>

<p>When preparing for an assignment, students check emails, syllabi, schedules, slides, and various Blackboard sections to get the information they need. By centralizing and parsing this information, Blackboard could present everything in a much simpler, task list &amp; calendar based format.</p>

<p>To further test the interactivity of this concept, I developed an interactive HTML prototype. I used an organizational convention students were familiar with, akin to color-coded binder sections. Preliminary testing suggests this works well with students.</p>
